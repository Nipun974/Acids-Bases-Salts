        <p class="intro">This website helps to understand the basics of what are acids, bases and salts. </p>
        <br>        
        <br> <p> The materials can be classified on the basis of their various properties such as colour, lustre, hardness, roughness, solubility and transparency. Materials can also be classified into three groups namely- ACIDS, BASES, SALTS on the basis of their taste.</p>

        <h1 class="headings">ACIDS</h1>
        <div class="left">
            <li class="points">They are sour in taste.</li>
            <li class="points">They are the substances which produce H+ ions in a solution.</li>
            <li class="points">There are two types of acids based on their sources, that is Organic and Inorganic.</li>
            <li class="points">Organic Acids- Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Ascorbic Acid.</li>
            <li class="points">Inorganic Acids- Sulphuric Acid, Hydrochloric Acid, Carbonic Acid.</li>
            <li class="points">They are also classified on the basis of their strength, that is weak and strong acids.</li>
            <li class="points">Acids are corrosive in nature and good conductors of electricity.</li>
            <li class="points">Few examples of acids are- Sulphuric Acid(Strong Acid), Citric acid in citrus fruits(Weak Acid), Lactic Acid in milk .etc</li>

    <section class="container" id="bases">
        <h1 class="headings">BASES</h1>
            <li class="points">They are the substances which produce or OH<sup>-</sup> ions in a solution.</li>
            <li class="points">They are bitter in taste and give a soapy feeling when touched.</li>
            <li class="points">Few of the bases can be dissolved in water and are called alkalis. Eg-Sodium hydroxide, Potassium hydroxide etc.</li>
            <li class="points">They are corrosive in nature. Eg- Cupric Hydroxide, Ferric Hydroxide.</li>

    <section class="container" id="salts">
        <h1 class="headings">SALTS</h1>
        <li class="points">Substances that are neither acidic or basic are called neutral substances or salts.</li>
        <li class="points">They are the product formed when a acid reacts with a base.</li>
        <li class="points">Eg- NaCl, NH<sub>4</sub>F,MgCO<sub>3</sub>....etc.</li>

    <section class="container" id="neut">
        <h1 class="headings">NEUTRALISATION REACTION</h1>
        <li class="points">The reaction in which an acid completely reacts with a base to form a salt and water is called neutralisation.</li>
        <li class="points">It is a exothermic reaction</li>
